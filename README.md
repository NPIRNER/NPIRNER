I'm an Army veteran with a strong passion for information security. I enlisted as an information technology specialist and during my time in the military I greatly diversified my skillset. I have recently obtained my Master's degree in Cybersecurity and I started this page to showcase my experience while also documenting all of the projects I've undertaken to enhance my expertise in the field.

## Objective

As a Cybersecurity graduate, I am eager to launch a career in the field and jump back into IT. Armed with academic expertise and prior IT knowledge from the military, I am ready to apply my knowledge and skills to the challenges in cybersecurity.
